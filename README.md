# Toyota_Used_Car_Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis of Used Toyota Cars

Variables: model, year, price, transmission, mileage, fuelType, mpg and engineSize.

Feature Variables: model, year, transmission, mileage, fuelType, mpg and engineSize.

Target Variable: price 

For homework 2 (Module 1), two categorical variables were chosen and visualized using barplot and piechart.

For homework 3 (Module 2), two scatterplots and regression plots were created using numeric columns of the datasets. Pair plots were also created and analyzed. Categorical variables were incorporated as hue where it was deemed necessary.

For homework 4 (Module 4), two histograms, boxplots and violin plots were plotted and compared, in regards to the data they can and can't provide.

# Toyota_Used_Car_Machine_Learning_Price_Prediction
For homework 1 (module 4), a simple ML model (Linear Regression) was implemented to predict the target variable (price) using four numeric feature variables (mileage, mpg, year, enginesize). In addition, key performance indicators (KPI) were used to evaluate the efficiency of the linear regression model.
